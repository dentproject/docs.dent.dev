# DENT Network Operating System

DENT is an open-source network operating system (NOS) designed for decentralized enterprises. It leverages familiar Linux commands for network configuration, providing an abstracted user experience. With DENT, users can configure switches from different vendors without the need to learn specific commands associated with each.

In the first release, Arthur, DENT utilizes the Linux 5.6 Kernel to leverage switchDev, enabling the replacement of proprietary SDKs and NOSes with a standard open Linux interface. It also supports existing Linux toolchains.

With the second release, "Beeblebrox," DENT now includes secure scaling with IPv6 and NAT.

In the third release, "Cynthia," developers promise a rapid release cycle that will implement Traffic Control Persistence, QoS, IGMP Policing, and Egress Policing.
